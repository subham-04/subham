          review: 'I know Subham for quite some times as he is my junior from same college. We have come across many times during hackathons, different coding competitions. I have seen a few folks having the amount of enthusiasm and learning capacity Subham has. He is truly a smart-working geek. And last but not the least, he is a good human being.'
